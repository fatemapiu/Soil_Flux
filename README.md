# Soil_Flux
Processing and visualizing soil greenhouse gas flux data from Gasmet GT5000 Terra, with sample datasets included.

Soil Gas Flux Data Processing – Gasmet GT5000 Terra

This repository contains Python scripts and sample data for processing soil greenhouse gas flux measurements collected using the Gasmet GT5000 Terra system. It calculates flux rates for CO₂ and N₂O, generates time-series plots, and produces output files suitable for further analysis.

Features

Process raw RESULTS.txt and log.txt files from soil gas measurements.

Calculate linear slopes of gas concentrations over time.

Generate plots for each sample showing gas concentrations with linear regression fits.

Compute soil fluxes (μmol m⁻² s⁻¹) using chamber geometry, volume, and temperature corrections.

Save processed results as CSV files for further analysis.
